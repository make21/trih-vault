Last updated: 2025-11-11  

---

## 1. Product Snapshot

**Goal**  
Make it effortless to “see the show as history”: a mobile-first vertical timeline for browsing, fast full-text search for discovery, and clean deep links to each series or episode.

**Primary Users**
- *Die-hard listeners* — recall favourite arcs, browse multi-part series, jump to specific instalments.
- *New listeners* — discover an approachable starting arc without endless podcast-app scrolling.

**Success Metrics (first 2 weeks post-launch)**
- ≥50% of sessions scroll past three decade markers on the timeline.
- ≥25% of sessions use search.
- ≥20% of sessions click through to a series or episode detail view.
- ≥5% share click-through rate from Twitter/OG previews (baseline for later OG image work).

---

## 2. Scope

**In v1**
- Mobile-first vertical timeline on `/` combining `public/series.json` and `public/episodes.json`.
- Undated items discoverable via a dedicated “Undated / Special” chip plus a supplemental list when browsing “All Eras.”
- Mixed client-side search (episodes + series) with People/Places facet chips (no type filter).
- Series detail pages (`/series/[slug]`) with narrative summaries and part lists.
- Episode detail pages (`/episode/[slug]`) with audio playback, people/places chips, and breadcrumbs.
- Deterministic slugs emitted during composition, plus `public/slug-registry.json`.
- Canonical URLs, sitemap, robots.txt, JSON-LD metadata, GA4 event instrumentation.
- Twitter/OG summary card (no custom image in v1).
- Local-only admin console at `/review` (hidden from crawlers) that lists unresolved LLM proposals and lets editors accept, reject, or map them without touching JSON files. Actions write directly to the registries and review log.

**Out of Scope (defer or post-v1)**
- Rich OG images.
- Server-side or hosted search engine.
- Advanced filters (themes, regions, timelines).
- Apple/Spotify canonical links (fallback to store search URLs).
- Personalized recommendations.

## 3. Data Inputs & Determinism

**`public/episodes.json`** (sorted by `publishedAt`)  
Fields: `id`, `slug`, `cleanTitle`, `cleanDescriptionText`, `audioUrl`, `keyPeople[]`, `keyPlaces[]`, `keyThemes[]`, `keyTopics[]`, `seriesId`, `yearFrom`, `yearTo`, `part`.

**`public/series.json`** (sorted by first member date)  
Fields: `id`, `slug`, `seriesTitle`, `narrativeSummary`, `episodeCount`, `episodeIds[]`, `yearFrom`, `yearTo`.

**`public/slug-registry.json`**  
Map of `{ [slug]: { type: "episode" | "series", id } }` produced by the composer. Enforces global slug uniqueness.

Composition ensures slugs are deterministic and consistent across runs; registry collisions are resolved predictably.

---

## 4. Information Architecture & Routing

| Route | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | Timeline home | Mobile-first vertical spine with sticky decade markers. |
| `/series/[slug]` | Series detail | Narrative, year span chip, ordered list of parts. |
| `/episode/[slug]` | Episode detail | Title, part badge, audio player, chips, description. |

Series pages link to their constituent episodes via `/episode/[episodeSlug]`. No nested routes in v1.

---

## 5. Slug Strategy (Programmatic, Deterministic)

Slugs are generated by deterministic helpers so any two runs over the same artefacts yield identical outputs. All logic follows the V7 rules shared with engineering:

- **Shared helper** — `slugify(text)` transliterates accents, lowercases, strips punctuation (preserving intra-word hyphens), removes stop words, and returns hyphenated tokens without truncating. Token budgeting happens in the calling strategy.
- **Series slugs** — `series.seriesTitle` is slugified; we keep the first four tokens (fallback to `seriesId` fragments if the title reduces to nothing). Example: `The French Revolution: From Versailles to the Rights of Man` → `french-revolution-versailles-rights`.
- **Episode slugs (standalone)** — Drop numeric prefixes and part labels from `cleanTitle`, slugify the remainder, and keep up to four tokens (fallback to UUID fragments if empty).
- **Episode slugs (series members)** — Combine:
  1. A **series handle**: first token in the parent series slug not present in the domain-topic list; fallback concatenates the first two tokens or uses the seriesId prefix.
  2. Up to **two subtitle tokens** from the episode (text after the first colon, or the full title if no colon).
  3. An optional **`ptN`** token when `part` is provided (no year fallback).
  Total tokens never exceed four; if adding `ptN` would exceed the limit, we drop the last subtitle token.
- **Collisions** — The slug registry builder appends stable numeric suffixes (`-2`, `-3`, …) when duplicates occur and persists those assignments.

Composer (or the registry build step) writes the resolved slugs onto artefacts and updates `public/slug-registry.json` atomically.

## 6. Timeline Experience (Home)

- **Hero & palette** — Parchment (#F8F6F3) background with oxblood (#6A1F1B) headline, serif typography, subtle radial gradients.
- **Latest Episode banner** — Beige capsule with clock icon, published date, CTA to the latest `/episode` slug. Fully keyboard-accessible.
- **Era chips** — Rounded pills in beige/oxblood. Options: All Eras, Prehistory, Ancient World, Late Antiquity & Early Middle Ages, High Middle Ages, Early Modern, Long 19th Century, 20th Century, 21st Century, Undated / Special. Chips update the `?era=` query param without a reload and preserve scroll position.
- **Timeline spine** — Stays centered on all breakpoints. Series and episode markers share the same axis; series markers use the secondary tint.
- **Cards** — Floating cards with parchment styling. Series cards include a “Series” pill, beige background, and collapsible part list; episodes stay white. Hover/focus lifts the card slightly.
- **Gap markers** — Collapsible dotted buttons with textual labels (“Gap of 642 years”). Expanded state stored per ID.
- **Undated / Special** — Selecting the undated chip shows the non-chronological drawer; otherwise, the drawer appears under the main timeline when viewing “All Eras.”
- **Ordering** — Series sorted by `yearFrom`/`yearTo` (ties by title). Standalone episodes sorted by `yearFrom`/`yearTo` then `cleanTitle`. Undated rows ordered by `publishedAt`.
- **Accessibility** — Chips expose `aria-pressed`, gap markers announce skipped years, cards retain visible focus rings. Contrasts adhere to WCAG AA.
- **BC labelling** — Negative `yearFrom`/`yearTo` render with `BC` suffixes (e.g. “264 BC – 216 BC”).

## 7. Visual System (Brand Palette)

- **Colors**
  - Background: parchment `#F8F6F3`.
  - Primary text: `#2A2522`.
  - Primary accent: oxblood `#6A1F1B` (hover `#8C2B24`).
  - Secondary accent: tan `#B89464` (hover `#D3B785`).
  - Cards: `#FFFFFF` / `#F2E4D4` (series tint).
  - Borders: `rgba(42, 37, 34, 0.12)`.
- **Typography**
  - Headlines: “Source Serif 4” (or Georgia fallback) with oxblood color.
  - Body copy: Inter/System stack in dark brown.
- **Texture**
  - Optional radial gradient overlays evoke parchment; no heavy illustrations in the current pass.
- **Components**
  - Pills, banners, chips, and quick-fact cards all reuse the palette above. Audio player uses the same card treatment for brand consistency.
- QA on mobile and desktop to verify performance, contrast, and scroll behaviour.

---

## 8. Search Experience (SERP)

- Single omnibox; queries match title, description, people, places, themes, and series titles.
- Results interleave series and episodes with a badge (“Series” / “Episode”).
- Optional facet chips for People and Places; toggling chips filters results client-side.
- Client-only search index using `minisearch` (preferred) or `Fuse.js`.
  - Indexed fields: `cleanTitle`, `cleanDescriptionText`, `seriesTitle`, `keyPeople`, `keyPlaces`, `keyThemes`, `keyTopics.label`.
  - Field boosts: title ×4, keyPeople ×3, keyPlaces ×2, others ×1.
- Analytics on search submissions and result clicks.

---

## 9. Detail Views

**Episode**
- Title + optional “Part N” badge (hidden when standalone).
- People, Places, and Topics chips (linking back to filtered search in post-v1 roadmap; topics use curated labels from the registry).
- Summary: short teaser (~160–200 chars) above the fold; full clean description below.
- Embedded HTML5 audio player (`<audio controls src={audioUrl}>`).
- Breadcrumb to series (if applicable) and prev/next navigation within the same series.

**Series**
- Title, narrative summary, episode count, optional year-span chip.
- Ordered list of parts with publication years and part badges; child rows link to episode detail pages.
- CTA to scroll timeline back to the series position (deep link anchor).

Accessibility: provide `aria-expanded` for collapsible sections, descriptive button labels, and ensure screen-reader ordering follows the visual layout.

---

## 10. SEO & Sharing

- Canonical URL per page (`/episode/[slug]`, `/series/[slug]`).
- `twitter:card=summary` (no image in v1).
- Open Graph:
  - `og:title`: `The Rest Is History — {cleanTitle}` or `TRIH Series — {seriesTitle}`.
  - `og:description`: first high-quality sentence (≤160 characters).
- JSON-LD:
  - Episodes as `PodcastEpisode` with `partOfSeries`.
  - Series as `CreativeWorkSeries`.
- `robots.txt` allows all crawlers.
- Sitemap generated from `public/slug-registry.json` either during publish or via `/sitemap.xml`.

---

## 11. Performance & Technical Notes

- Client fetches `public/episodes.json`, `public/series.json`, and `public/slug-registry.json` once; leverage CDN caching.
- Trim index payload (only store fields required for search) to keep bundle sizes manageable.
- Static generation with Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):
  - `generateStaticParams` reads `slug-registry.json` for pre-render.
  - `revalidate` ~300 s for detail pages, or on-demand revalidation triggered by pipeline publish.
- Long-cache immutable assets; bust via filename hashing when necessary.
- Target Core Web Vitals budgets; avoid layout shift by reserving space for timeline elements.

---

## 12. Analytics (GA4)

- `timeline_scroll_depth` (25 / 50 / 75% markers).
- `search_submit` and `search_result_click`.
- `filter_chip_click` (People/Places).
- `open_series`, `open_episode`.
- `audio_play`.

Integrate via GA4 gtag events with consistent parameters (`content_type`, `content_id`, etc.).

---

## 13. Build & Deploy (Vercel)

- Next.js App Router, static-friendly architecture.
- ISR or on-demand revalidation for detail pages.
- Scheduled GitHub Actions pipeline commits refreshed JSON artefacts to `main`, then calls the Vercel revalidation webhook; deployments pick up changes automatically.
- Ensure environment variables (GA4 measurement ID, etc.) are provisioned in Vercel.
- Monitor build size and ensure JSON artefacts remain below Vercel’s 10 MB edge limit per file.

---

## 14. v1 Ship Checklist

## 15. Risks & Mitigations

- **Large JSON payloads** — mitigate via virtualised lists and trimmed search index; escalate to server-driven search if growth demands.
- **Missing year ranges** — dedicated “Undated” section keeps ordering deterministic; consider LLM-assisted backfill in future iterations.
- **Slug collisions** — `slug-registry.json` and deterministic resolver enforce uniqueness; add unit tests around collision cases.
- **Asset-less sharing** — rely on text-only summary card for v1; roadmap includes `/api/og` endpoint for richer previews.

---

## 16. Roadmap (Post-v1)

1. Dynamic OG image endpoint (`/api/og`) for richer link previews.
2. Additional filters (themes, regions) and chip-linking from detail pages.
3. Server-side search (Meilisearch/Typesense) if dataset outgrows client index.
4. Apple/Spotify canonical link resolver service.
5. Timeline “mini-map”, random episode button, lightweight favourites (local storage).

---

## 17. Open Questions

- Who owns ongoing GA4 analysis and reporting post-launch?
- Do we need a privacy notice or cookie banner when GA4 goes live?
- Should undated items also surface an inferred year if LLM enrichment suggests one?
- What is the minimum acceptable accessibility score (e.g., Lighthouse ≥90) before launch?
